I put together another mix. This one is a way of replicating some feelings of when I saw John Digweed play a monster 5hr set back in 2002. It was the best thing I ever heard. He lays down a groove and sits you in it and never lets up. Hour after hour of relentless, mesmerising tunes. A vortex that you can't escape. It was wonderful, and I wish I could hear it again. To that end, this is my best shot so far at making something along those lines.
